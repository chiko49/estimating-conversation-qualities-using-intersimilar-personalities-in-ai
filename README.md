# Project Overview

This project, **Conversation Quality Estimation using Intersimilar Personalities in AI**, is designed to analyze and evaluate the quality of conversations by extracting sentiments from group discussions. It provides a comprehensive solution to measure conversational dynamics using sentiment analysis and personality intersimilarity algorithms.

## Objectives

- Estimate the quality of group conversations by analyzing sentiment trends.
- Use intersimilar personality traits to assess conversational engagement.
- Ensure the codebase is scalable, maintainable, and easy to extend for future improvements.

## Key Features

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Extract and analyze sentiments from conversations.
- **Personality Matching**: Evaluate personality intersimilarity for conversation quality estimation.
- **Data Processing**: Handle and process conversational data efficiently.
- **Scalability**: Support multiple conversation datasets for analysis.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Frameworks/Libraries**: TensorFlow, Transformers (Hugging Face), Scikit-learn
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub
